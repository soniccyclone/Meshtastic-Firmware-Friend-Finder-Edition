## ⚙️ Hardware Requirements

For the Friend Finder module to work, specific hardware is required.

| Component | Model / Specification | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Device**| Heltec (V3), LilyGo T-LoRa T3-S3 V1 | Other ESP32-S3 devices may work but require individual testing. |
| **GPS Module** | Any Meshtastic-compatible GPS | **Required.** Any module supported by the base firmware will work. The u-blox M8N is recommended for its high accuracy. |
| **Magnetometer** | QMC5883L | **Highly Recommended.** The directional arrow makes finding friends in crowded spaces much easier. Other magnetometers may work but are untested. |

> **IMPORTANT: Magnetometer Wiring**
> The correct I²C pins vary by device. Here are the confirmed wiring configurations. The firmware is designed to use the **secondary I²C bus** (`I2C1`) where available.

#### Heltec (V3) (Confirmed)
| Magnetometer | Pin | Heltec V3 | Pin |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | ---: |
| **SDA** | -> | **GPIO 41** | |
| **SCL** | -> | **GPIO 42** | |

#### LilyGo T-LoRa T3-S3 V1 (Unconfirmed)
| Magnetometer | Pin | T-LoRa S3 | Pin |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | ---: |
| **SDA** | -> | **GPIO 43** | |
| **SCL** | -> | **GPIO 44** | |

#### Finding Pins on Other Devices
To find the correct I²C pins for an unsupported ESP32-S3 board, you must look in the firmware source code for the board's variant file.
1.  Navigate to the variants directory in the source code. The path will be similar to `firmware/src/variants/esp32s3/your_board_name/`.
2.  Open the `variant.h` file.
3.  Search for the following definitions to find the correct GPIO pin numbers for the secondary I²C bus:
    ```cpp
    #define I2C_SDA1 SDA
    #define I2C_SCL1 SCL
    ```

## 🛠️ Advanced Features & Tools

### 📍 Using Saved Places
This feature lets you save your current location to one of four available slots. You can then start a tracking session to get a directional arrow that guides you back to that spot—perfect for finding your car, tent, or campsite.

**To Save a Location:**
1.  Stand at the physical location you wish to save. A GPS lock is required.
2.  Navigate to `Friend Finder` -> `Saved Places`.
3.  Select **"Save Current Location"**.
4.  The device will save your coordinates to the first available empty slot (e.g., "Place 1").

**To Track a Saved Location:**
1.  Navigate to `Friend Finder` -> `Saved Places`.
2.  Select the place you want to track from the list (e.g., "Place 1").
3.  From the action menu, choose **"Track"**.
4.  The tracking screen will appear and guide you to your saved location.

### 🔬 Developer Tools
This menu contains diagnostic tools for testing and debugging. More tools may be added in the future.

**Spoof Test**
The Spoof Test is a tool to verify that your compass and the arrow-drawing logic are working perfectly, independent of any real-world GPS or LoRa issues.

When you start a test, it creates a fake target exactly 1km away in a perfect cardinal direction (North, East, South, or West) from your current location.

**How to Run the Test:**
1.  Navigate to `Friend Finder` -> `Dev Tools` -> `Run Spoof Test`.
2.  Select a target to track, for example, **"Track East"**.
3.  Physically point the top of your device towards **True North** (your compass screen should read 0°).
4.  The arrow on the tracking screen should now point directly to the **right** (90°). If it does, your UI is behaving as expected.

## 🧭 A Guide to Magnetometer Calibration

### Why is Calibration Important?
Your magnetometer (compass) is sensitive to magnetic fields. This includes not only the Earth's magnetic field but also interference from nearby electronics, batteries, and metal objects. Calibration is crucial to teach the sensor how to distinguish between the Earth's magnetic north and this local interference, ensuring the directional arrow is accurate.

### When to Calibrate
You should perform a full two-step calibration:
-   **Upon first installation** of the magnetometer.
-   If you add or move components inside your device's case.
-   If the directional arrow seems consistently inaccurate or erratic.

### The Two-Step Calibration Process
For the best results, perform these calibrations outdoors, away from large metal objects like cars, buildings, or metal benches.

#### **1. Figure-8 Calibration (Hard & Soft Iron)**
This is the most important step. It corrects for magnetic fields originating from the device itself (like the battery, speaker, or wires).

1.  On the device, navigate to `Friend Finder` -> `Compass Cal`.
2.  Select **Figure-8 Cal** from the menu.
3.  Hold the device out in front of you.
4.  For 15 seconds, slowly move the device in a large figure-8 pattern. As you move it, twist and rotate your wrist to ensure the device points in every possible direction (up, down, left, right, forwards, backward, etc.). Imagine you are a flying a toy airplane through loops and rolls.
5.  The screen will return to the compass view when complete.

#### **2. Flat-Spin Calibration (2D Alignment)**
This routine fine-tunes the compass for when it's held relatively flat, which is a common use case.

1.  On the device, navigate to `Friend Finder` -> `Compass Cal`.
2.  Select **Flat-Spin Cal** from the menu.
3.  Place the device face-up on a flat, **non-metallic** surface (a wooden table or the ground works well).
4.  For 12 seconds, smoothly rotate the device **CLOCKWISE**. Try for at least 2-3 full rotations.
5.  The screen will return to the compass view when complete.

### Additional Compass Tools
The calibration menu has a few other useful tools:
-   **Set North Here**: If you have a real compass and know which way is true north, point the top of the device in that direction and select this option. It will apply an offset so the device's 0° heading aligns with true north.
-   **Clear North Offset**: Removes any manual offset created by "Set North Here".
-   **Flip North**: This flips the compass heading by 180°. Use this if your magnetometer was accidentally installed backward and the arrow points directly away from your friend.

### Troubleshooting Tips
-   **Arrow points the wrong way:** If the arrow consistently points in the wrong direction (e.g., behind you), first try the **Flip North** option. If it's still off, you likely spun the device **counter-clockwise** during the Flat-Spin calibration. Redo the flat-spin, ensuring you rotate smoothly clockwise.
-   **Arrow is erratic or "jumpy":** This usually indicates strong local magnetic interference. Make sure the magnetometer is mounted away from wires (especially the battery lead) and other metal components. You should also redo the **Figure-8 calibration** away from any potential sources of interference.

## 📡 Performance & Technical Notes

-   **LoRa Settings**: All testing has been conducted using the **LongFast** channel preset.
-   **Update Interval**: To keep channel utilization low, position updates are sent every **20 seconds**. Faster LoRa settings may support more frequent updates, but this requires further community testing.
-   **Range**: The effective tracking range depends entirely on your device, antenna, LoRa settings, and the surrounding environment. Hops may not be supported, this hasn't been tested.

---

## 📝 Notes:

1. 
    * If the tracking compass is rotating the wrong way: You need to redo the flat-spin calibration **CLOCKWISE ->**
    * When installing the magnetometer chip to the device, keep it away from other components and wires for better accuracy. Make sure it's firmly secured and flat.
    * As said above, use ports SDA=41, SCL=42. If it doesn't work, try flipping the wires.
    * A decent GPS module is recommended. All testing was done with u-blox m8n chips. My testing showed they were accurate to 1-3m when used outdoors.
    * The Meshtastic Android app is fully usable with this custom firmware.
    * If you want to stop a friend tracking you permanently, you will have to remove them as a friend on the "Track a friend" menu.
    * I recommend a 3000mah battery when paried with a heltec v3 if you want it to last a full day.

## Final words:
This project as been my main focus since Feburary 2025. I've had lots of fun developing it and I feel like it will be a great addition to the offical firmware when it's fully polished. It's really exciting to see how everyone will be using it. 

I tested it at a large 1 day music festival in Milton Keynes in august and it worked great. Security didn't know what to think when getting in but saw no issue after showing them how it worked. I was able to walk into the crowd and later find my friends with no issues at all. I simply started a tracking session and the arrow pointed me to the group from 350 meters away.

I love you all, have fun!
